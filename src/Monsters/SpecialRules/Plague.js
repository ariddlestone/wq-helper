                Some Monsters carry a horrible, disfiguring disease known simply as the Plague and may infect their
                opponents with it in combat. If your Warrior is reduced to 0 Wounds by such a Monster his Toughness is
                permanently reduced by 1 when he is healed to 1 or more Wounds. If a Warrior is reduced to 0 Toughness
                he is killed and removed from play.
