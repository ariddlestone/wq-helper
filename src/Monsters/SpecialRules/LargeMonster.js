                Some Monsters are so big that they are known by the special term Large Monster. Obvious examples are
                Dragons and Giants. When placing a Large Monster on the board draw a Warrior counter. That player places
                the model anywhere on the board, facing any direction and moving other Monsters or Warriors to make room
                as required. Then draw a second Warrior counter to determine who the Monster attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any offensive spells cast against a Large Monster require a number of extra points of power, equal to
                the level of the Monster table that generated the Monster, to cast.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a Large Monster manages to kill a Warrior and still has some unused Attacks left over it may choose
                any other available target and carry on.
            </p>
