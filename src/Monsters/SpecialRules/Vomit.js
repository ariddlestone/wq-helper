                Some Monsters (namely Trolls) have a special Vomit attack, regurgitating the highly corrosive contents
                of its stomach all over the Warrior it is attacking.

            <p>
                In addition to making such a Monster's normal attacks, roll 1D6. If the score is a 5+, the Monster has
                vomited on its foe. If the victim has any armour (including shields or a helmet) he loses one piece of
                it as the acid eats it away. The player concerned can choose which item his Warrior loses. If he hasn't
                got any armour, the target loses 1D6+2 Wounds, with no modifiers for Toughness.
